# python-scsi


## What is it?

Python classes to access SG_IO scsi devices ...
It's not intended to be a wrapper for other tools, like sg3_utils, so the code is splitted in two main pieces. A Python C Extention, with basic functionality to do calls to ioctl, and a python package to utilize the the c extention methods. 

## How to build/install an run the code?

### get the source

You can either use git to clone the source or simple download the zip from:

https://github.com/rosjat/python-scsi/archive/master.zip 

Then unzip it to your filesystem (mainly somewere in your home directory).
If you use git simply use the following command in your shell:

    $ git clone git@github.com:rosjat/python-scsi.git
 
This will clone the source code to the current directory. If you download the zip archive with the source then you  just need to unpack on your machine.
